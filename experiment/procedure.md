# Procedure for Calibration of AC Voltmeter and AC Ammeter

## Calibration of Ammeter:

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the circuit as per the given diagram.
   - Ensure the ammeter is placed in series with the load and power source.

2. **Increase the Load Step by Step:**
   - Use the single-pole switches to gradually increase the load.
   - Start with the lowest load setting and increase it incrementally until the ammeter shows full-scale deflection.

3. **Take Observations:**
   - Record the ammeter reading (testing value) and the corresponding standard value (from a reference instrument) at each step.
   - Perform at least six observations across the range of the ammeter.

4. **Calculate Percentage Error:**
   - For each observation, calculate the percentage error using the formula:
     ```
     Percentage Error = (|Testing Value - Standard Value| / Standard Value) * 100
     ```

5. **Repeat if Necessary:**
   - Check consistency of readings and repeat the measurements if needed to ensure accuracy.

## Calibration of Voltmeter:

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the circuit as per the given diagram.
   - Ensure the voltmeter is connected in parallel with the load.

2. **Adjust the Rheostat:**
   - Adjust the rheostat to set the voltmeter to a low value initially.

3. **Increase Voltage Step by Step:**
   - Gradually increase the voltage by adjusting the rheostat, ensuring the voltmeter displays readings up to full-scale deflection.

4. **Take Observations:**
   - Record the voltmeter reading (testing value) and the standard value (from a reference device) at each step.
   - Perform at least six observations across the full voltage range of the voltmeter.

5. **Calculate Percentage Error:**
   - For each observation, calculate the percentage error using the formula:
     ```
     Percentage Error = (|Testing Value - Standard Value| / Standard Value) * 100
     ```

6. **Repeat if Necessary:**
   - Check the consistency of readings and repeat the measurements if needed.
