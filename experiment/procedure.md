# Procedure for Calibration of AC Voltmeter and AC Ammeter

## Calibration of Ammeter:

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the circuit as per the given diagram.
   - Ensure the ammeter is placed in series with the load and power source.

2. **Increase the Load Step by Step:**
   - Use the single-pole switches to gradually increase the load.
   - Start with the lowest load setting and increase it incrementally until the ammeter shows full-scale deflection.

3. **Take Observations:**
   - Record the ammeter reading (testing value) and the corresponding standard value (from a reference instrument) at each step.
   - Perform at least six observations across the range of the ammeter.

4. **Calculate Percentage Error:**
   - For each observation, calculate the percentage error using the formula:
     ```
     Percentage Error = (|Testing Value - Standard Value| / Standard Value) * 100
     ```

5. **Repeat if Necessary:**
   - Check consistency of readings and repeat the measurements if needed to ensure accuracy.

## Calibration of Voltmeter:

1. **Set Up the Circuit:**
   - Connect the circuit as per the given diagram.
   - Ensure the voltmeter is connected in parallel with the load.

2. **Adjust the Rheostat:**
   - Adjust the rheostat to set the voltmeter to a low value initially.

3. **Increase Voltage Step by Step:**
   - Gradually increase the voltage by adjusting the rheostat, ensuring the voltmeter displays readings up to full-scale deflection.

4. **Take Observations:**
   - Record the voltmeter reading (testing value) and the standard value (from a reference device) at each step.
   - Perform at least six observations across the full voltage range of the voltmeter.

5. **Calculate Percentage Error:**
   - For each observation, calculate the percentage error using the formula:
     ```
     Percentage Error = (|Testing Value - Standard Value| / Standard Value) * 100
     ```

6. **Repeat if Necessary:**
   - Check the consistency of readings and repeat the measurements if needed.

## Conclusion:
- After performing the calibration steps for both the ammeter and voltmeter, evaluate the percentage errors and assess the accuracy of the instruments. This procedure ensures the proper functioning of the measuring devices in an AC circuit.
