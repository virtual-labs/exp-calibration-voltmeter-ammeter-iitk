      "question": "1. An Ammeter is connected in ---------- with the circuit",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Parallel",
        "b": "Both parallel and series",
        "c": "series",
        "d": "None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Connecting an ammeter in parallel could damage it due to low internal resistance.",
        "b": "Incorrect. An ammeter is only connected in series to measure current accurately.",
        "c": "An ammeter is connected in series because same current will flow in the circuit. To calculate the current it must be connected in series.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Ammeter must be connected in series."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",

      "question": "2. In a circuit , voltmeter is always connected in ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Triangular",
        "b": "Parallel",
        "c": "Series",
        "d": "Either series or parallel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. 'Triangular' is not a valid circuit configuration.",
        "b": "Voltmeter is connected in parallel because voltage is same in parallel circuits.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Voltmeter in series would affect circuit current due to high resistance.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A voltmeter is *only* connected in parallel."

      "question": "3. Which one of the following is used to measure direct current? ",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Voltmeter",
        "b": "Ammeter ",
        "c": "Multimeter",
        "d": "Coupler"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Voltmeter is used to measure voltage, not current.",
        "b": "Ammeter is specifically designed to measure current, including direct current.",
        "c": "Multimeter is used to calculate DC current along with other parameters like voltage and resistance.",
        "d": "Incorrect. A coupler is not used for measuring current; it's used for signal transfer."

        "b": "Voltage ",
        "c": "Resistance ",
        "d": "Power "
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Current is measured using an ammeter.",
        "b": "Correct. A voltmeter is used to measure voltage in the circuit.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Resistance is measured using an ohmmeter or multimeter.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Power is calculated using voltage and current, not directly measured with a voltmeter."

      "question": "5. Calibration is used for measuring_____",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Accuracy",
        "b": "Precision",
        "c": "Deflection",
        "d": " None of these"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Calibration is used for measuring and improving the accuracy of an instrument or system.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Precision refers to repeatability, not accuracy, and is not directly assessed through calibration.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Deflection refers to needle movement in analog devices and is not the focus of calibration.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Accuracy is the correct answer."
