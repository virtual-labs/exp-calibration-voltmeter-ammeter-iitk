Calibration is the process of checking the accuracy of an instrument or measurement system by comparing its readings with a known, reference standard. In other words, calibration verifies the correctness of the instrument by comparing its output to the reference value. It helps identify any errors in the instrumentâ€™s readings and allows for adjustments to ensure the instrument provides accurate and ideal measurements.

<b>Calibration of voltmeter :</b><br><br>
Calibration of Voltmeter is the process of checking the accuracy of the reading of the Voltmeter under test (V<sub>t</sub>) by comparing it with the standard Voltmeter (V<sub>s</sub>) one. In other words, calibration checks the correctness of the instrument by comparing it with the reference standard. <br><br>

<b>Calibration of ammeter :</b><br><br>
Calibration of Ammeter is the process of checking the accuracy of the reading of the ammeter under test (A<sub>t</sub>) by comparing it with the standard Ammeter (A<sub>s</sub>) one. In other words, calibration checks the correctness of the instrument by comparing it with the reference standard. <br><br>
