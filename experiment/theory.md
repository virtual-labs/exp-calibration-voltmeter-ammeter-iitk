The calibration is the process of checking the accuracy of the result by comparing it with the standard value.<br> In other words, calibration checks the correctness of the instrument by comparing it with the reference standard.<br> It helps us in determining the error occurring in the reading and adjusts the voltages for getting the ideal reading.<br><h4>Percentage Error:  [(T-S)/S]*100 </h4>
  where : T= Test value<br>
              S= Standard value
 <h3>Calibration of voltmeter:</h3><br>Calibration of Voltmeter is the process of checking the accuracy of the reading of the Voltmeter under <br>test (Vt) by comparing it with the standard 
Voltmeter (Vs) one.<br> In other words, calibration checks the correctness of the instrument by comparing it with the reference standard

where :    Vt = Test value       Vs = Standard value
<h3>Calibration of ammeter:</h3><br>
Calibration of Ammeter is the process of checking the accuracy of the reading of the ammeter under <br>test (At) by comparing it with the standard 
Ammeter (As) one. <br>In other words, calibration checks the correctness of the instrument by comparing it with the reference standard<br>
%Error Ammeter =  [(  At - As )/ As ]x100<br>
where :    At = Test value       As = Standard value<br>
