### About the Experiment 
The calibration is the process of checking the accuracy of the result by comparing it with the standard value.
In other words, calibration checks the correctness of the instrument by comparing it with the reference standard.
It helps us in determining the error occurring in the reading and adjusts the voltages for getting the ideal reading.
